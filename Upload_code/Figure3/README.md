Figure 3. displays the advantage of the propsed observable shift method over conventional method in terms of sampling overhead. 

The code can is written by Matlab, and utilized the semidefinite programming package "CVX"

Please execute the MainExperiment.m to generate data first, then plot the figure by executing PlotFigure.m directly.

The file contains the following contents:

- Method_1.m : The SDP for channel inverse method.
- Method_2.m : The SDP for information recover method, which is proposed in "Information recoverability of noisy quantum states". In this paper, this is not talked too much.
- Method_3.m : The SDP for the observable shift method, which is proposed in this paper.
- SwapGenerator.m : Generate the swap operator, which is used to constructed observable for high oerder moment.
- tensor.m: A function to realize tensor.
- Dual_SDP.m: The Dual SDP for observable shift method, i.e., Method_3
- MainExperiments.m: Generate the optimal sampling cost by SDP with different noisy channels and noisy levels.
- PlotFigure.m: Plot the data generate by MainExperiments.m, which corresponds to the Figure.3 in paper.
